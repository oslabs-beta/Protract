## About Protract

Protract is an accessible developer tool built from the ground up to assist with the blueprinting of Angular applications, simplifying the process of creating a hierarchy of components and allowing developers to quickly create the structure of their app so they can start coding faster.

[Here](https://jpino831.medium.com/ease-into-your-next-react-app-with-fflow-f60c5a899817) is a medium article describing the philosophy behind Protract.

Visit our website here ðŸ‘‰ https://Protract.dev
